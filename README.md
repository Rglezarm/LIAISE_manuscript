Hi all!

This folder contains the Python scripts used to produce the research and create the figures of the manuscript titled "On the impact of canopy environmental drivers on the diurnal and sub-diurnal dynamics of the leaf and canopy water and carbon dioxide exchange" submitted to Biogeoscience scientific journal the X of September 2023.

In the Folder "Creating_figures", you can find the Python scripts that were used to create all the figures of the manuscript.

In the Folder "CLASS_python_models", you can find the Python versions used to do the experiments ("model_V3.py" for all excepting for the PAR-CLD experiment in which "model_cloud.py" was used) and the settings of the experiments (in "sensitivity_control_cases.py").

Finally, in "tendencies_leaf_gas_exchange" folder, you can find a function to calculate the terms of the budget tendency equations for the output of the CLASS model. As an example to know how to use the function you can see "Creating_figures/Fig6_tendencies_Control.py".

The data used has not been published for now but it will be made available on request. Please feel free to contact us if a bug is found or if the observational data, additional information or additional code documentation is desired.

All the best,

Raquel Gonz√°lez Armas (raquel.gonzalezarmas@wur.nl)
